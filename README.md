### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My github contains a wide range of projects I have created over the years. Some of these projects were created while completing my Bachelor's Degree in Web Design and Development from Full Sail University. Other projects are used to advance my skills and knowledge in this forever growing field. My personal projects are listed here as well.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working

on a project that centers around professional wrestling. It allows promoters of companies to schedule events and manage their rosters. Another project I"m working on involes sheet music organization. This application allows musicians the ability to keep track of their sheet music library.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

more about server management. I keep up with updates for Laravel and the most recent technologies.
